# Automated Cheque Information Extraction and Verification Using Machine Learning

This repository contains code and notebooks for automating cheque information extraction and verification using machine learning techniques. The project focuses on detecting cheque objects, performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and utilizing YOLOv8 models for epoch and version comparisons.

## Requirements

To run the provided notebooks and scripts, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Tesseract-OCR
- PyTesseract
- YOLOv8 for object detection
